# Chrome Extensions Repository

This repository is dedicated to the Chrome Extensions I have developed, aimed at enhancing the browsing experience by introducing new functionalities directly into the Chrome browser. Currently, the repository hosts two main extensions: **Glossary** and **Image Downloader**. Each extension is organized into its own directory, which includes the source code, necessary assets, and a README for documentation.

## Extensions Overview

### Glossary
The **Glossary** extension is designed to help users quickly look up definitions and explanations of terms directly within their browsing context. It's particularly useful for students, researchers, and anyone looking to enhance their vocabulary while online.

### Image Downloader
The **Image Downloader** extension allows users to easily download images from any webpage. It provides a simple interface to select, preview, and download images in just a few clicks, making it an essential tool for designers, photographers, and anyone needing to collect images from the web efficiently.
